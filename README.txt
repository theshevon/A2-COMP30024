Agents/ Enemies:

adam                   - Random Agent (Formerly 'power_puff_boys')
asil                   - Greedy Agent (Greedy on reaching exit)
john                   - Greedy Agent (Greedy on reaching exit but prioritises cutting enemy pieces at the same time)
AI_DontKnowWhatImDoing - Stable agent that utilizes minimax but has subpar performance (for now)
amie                   - Agent that utilizes minimax with alpha-beta pruning. Cuts as many pieces as possible but can't exit and so is as annoying as (in)humanly possible (Name based on the real life tragedies of Shevon Mendis. Formerly 'ppb_alpha_beta')
calvin_huang           - Best agent we have, albeit the float to int conversion bug
