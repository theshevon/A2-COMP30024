Agents/ Enemies:

Adam         - Random Agent (Formerly 'power_puff_boys')
Asil         - Greedy Agent (Greedy on reaching exit)
John         - Greedy Agent (Greedy on reaching exit but priorities cutting enemy pieces at the same time)
AI_Papi      - Stable agent that utilizes minimax but has subpar performance (for now)
Amie         - Agent that utilizes minimax with alpha-beta pruning. Cuts as many pieces as possible but can't exit and so is as annoying as (in)humanly possible (Formerly 'ppb_alpha_beta')
calvin_huang - Best agent we have albeit the float to int conversion bug
